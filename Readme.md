# Pretrained models on 60k synthesized names for gender/110k usernames for ethnicity to predict gender and ethnicity based of text username/name using LSTM inspired by AndrewNg DeepLearning.ai which works best for Indian names with > 88% accuracy.

Requirements

```
Python 3.6
Pandas 
Numpy
Tensorflow 1.10
```

Run
```
python predict_gender_and_ethnicity.py
```

Modify the sample names in the python script with your own text and try!

You can retrain the model to work for gender and ethnicity of any country using the string_vectorizer. Need GPUs to train for worldwide.
